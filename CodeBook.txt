Codebook is for r script run_analysis.R. 

Directions for R Script:
	1. Download the zip file with the Samsung activiy data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and save to your working directory.
	2. Unzip the file and save the contents to your working directory.
	3. Make sure X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt, X_train.txt, y_training, and subject_train are all saved to your working directory.
	4. Update the working directory at line 4 in the R script.
	5. Run the R script.
	6. Tidy dataset Run_Analysis_Tidy_Dataset will contain the average of each variable from the activity dataset from the Samsung phone data grouped by Subject_ID and Activity_ID.

Required Packages:
	1. dplyr
	2. tidyr

Samsung Data from zip file:
Data are from a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
