=====================================================================
Repo contains work for "Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 Course Project."
Files included in repo are r script, codebook, and tidy dataset from r script.

Codebook- describes the variables in the tidy data from the r script, the data, and any transformations annd work performed to clean up the data. Codebok is called CodeBook.md.

R Script - Called run_analysis.R does the five actions listed below to the test and trainging data extracted from the Zip file https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip:
The test and training data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Tidy Data - provides the mean of each variable on the tidydataset by activity ID and Subject ID.
